AppEngine based Markov-Chain tweet generator.

Set-up notes:

+ markov/secrets.py: 

  This holds the consumer_secret and the cookie_secret for the applicatoin.
  The former for Twitter OAuth and the latter for a "secure" cookie implementation so
  that a username can be stored on the client side but not forged.

  The file `secrets.py' is ignored in .gitignore so it must be setup at deployment
  time.

Also see vendor/README for library dependencies.
